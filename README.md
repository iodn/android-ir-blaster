IR Blaster is an Android application that unlocks the full potential of your built-in infrared (IR) blaster. The app lets you control a wide range of devices using custom remote commands.

## Overview

IR Blaster supports both hexadecimal (e.g., NEC, NECext) and raw IR codes, offering an intuitive interface to generate and manage your own remote commands. With added support for importing `.IR` files generated by [Flipper Zero](https://flipperzero.one/), you can easily tap into a [community-curated collection](https://github.com/Lucaslhm/Flipper-IRDB) of IR codes.

> **Note:** Your device must have a built-in IR blaster to use this application.

## Features

- **Custom Remote Commands:** Create and manage remotes using hexadecimal or raw IR codes.
- **Flipper Zero Integration:** Import `.IR` files to leverage IR codes gathered by the Flipper Zero community.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Simple and intuitive design for quick setup and operation.
- **Broad Compatibility:** Works with any IR-enabled Android device.

## Requirements

- An Android device with a built-in IR blaster.
