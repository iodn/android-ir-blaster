## Changelog notes

### Fixed

* Fixed an issue where remote buttons could not be reordered.
* Fixed Flipper Zero `.ir` imports: files using the **Kaseikyo** protocol were incorrectly sent as **NECext**. Imported Flipper Zero files now preserve the correct protocol.

### Added

* Added an option to change the **Remote View orientation** (rotate layout), useful when your USB IR dongle is plugged into a phone port located at the bottom/top so the buttons remain easy to read.
