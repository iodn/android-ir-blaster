## Changelog notes
1. IR Finder / Database-Assisted Testing Controls

* Added persistent test state so scans can be paused and resumed without losing progress.
* Implemented manual execution controls: single-step mode and manual trigger for advancing one code at a time.
* Improved workflow stability for large remotes by avoiding forced restart-from-beginning scans and long "wait until next code" delays.

2. ZazaRemote Compatibility

* Added support for importing and using ZazaRemote remote formats and data structures.
* Improved remote parsing and normalization to match ZazaRemote button naming and layout conventions.

3. Themed App Icon (Android 13+)

* Added a monochrome icon layer to enable system-themed app icons on supported Android versions.
* Updated adaptive icon assets to comply with modern Android icon design requirements.

4. Button Creation: Database-Assisted Suggestions

* Enhanced the "Create New Button" flow to optionally fetch candidate IR values from the app's local database.
* Kept manual value entry fully supported while enabling faster setup using known/previously discovered codes.

5. Remote View: Quick Actions

* Added a "Quick Edit" action directly inside Remote View for faster button adjustments.
* Added an in-context "Create New Button" shortcut in Remote View to reduce navigation and improve editing speed.
